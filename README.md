# LTI Base Boilerplate
A base package for LTI tools built on edX, simple to write and deploy.  

# Setup
1. Edit config.php with your respective LTI keys and optional database details
2. Host on a https server (LTI with edX requires HTTPS)
3. Add the respective keys in the edX advanced settings
4. Create a new LTI component and point it to the correct URL

# Usage
1. use test.php with LTI to confirm that everything is connecting
2. on each page, include <?php require_once('inc/header.php'); ?> at the top
3. to ensure valid LTI, make sure to run $lti->requirevalid(); directly after header.php

# Testing
For testing we recommend the LTI 1.1 testbed, available at: http://www.imsglobal.org/developers/LTI/test/v1p1/lms.php
